The way you glow through my blinds in the morning
It makes me feel like you missed me.
Kissing my forehead to help me out of bed.
Making me rub the sleepy from my eyes.
Are you asking me to come out and play?
Are you trusting me to wish away a rainy day?
I look above. The sky is blue.
It's a secret, but I trust you too.
If it wasn't for you, I could sleep forever.

I pop off my scalp like the lid of a cookie jar.
It's the secret place where I keep all my dreams.
Little balls of sunshine, all rubbing together like a bundle of kittens.
I reach inside with my thumb and forefinger and pluck one out.
It's warm and tingly.
But there's no time to waste! I put it in a bottle to keep it safe.
And I put the bottle on the shelf with all of the other bottles.
Happy thoughts, happy thoughts, happy thoughts in bottles, all in a row.
My collection makes me lots of friends.
Each bottle a starlight to make amends.
Sometimes my friend feels a certain way.
Down comes a bottle to save the day.
Night after night, more dreams.
Friend after friend, more bottles.
Deeper and deeper my fingers go.
Like exploring a dark cave, discovering the secrets hiding in the nooks and crannies.
Digging and digging.
Scraping and scraping.
I blow dust off my bottle caps.
It doesn't feel like time elapsed.
My empty shelf could use some more.
My friends look through my locked front door.
Finally, all done. I open up, and in come my friends.
In they come, in such a hurry. Do they want my bottles that much?
I frantically pull them from the shelf, one after the other.
Holding them out to each and every friend.
Each and every bottle.
But every time I let one go, it shatters against the tile between my feet.
Happy thoughts, happy thoughts, happy thoughts in shards, all over the floor.
They were supposed to be for my friends, my friends who aren't smiling.
They're all shouting, pleading. Something.
But all I hear is echo, echo, echo, echo, echo
Inside my head."""

The once-prosperous field before me

The universe gives fruits of life to all of us.
They all have diverse sizes and shapes.
But no-one knows their real taste,
Because each person tastes them in their own way.
Some people can only feel a bitter taste,

Others feel they are sweet and very tasty,
Whatever fruit it may be that they have got in their hands.
For me, they taste like liquorice sweets.
I needed time to understand how sweet they really are,
To get rid of those unpleasant feelings,
Which I got after my first bites.
Now, all I want is to eat my own fruit
With the person who helped me find their real taste.
But I shouldn’t forget to do my real job here:
Finding a way to make others taste their fruits the same."""

An angel whose wings are blacker than those of devils,
An angel who thought herself a goddess,
An angel who was supposed to care
for the friends she had killed.
Now I deserve to lie in the rough burning ground 
in which I’ve been imprinted in,
For all the pain I've caused my friends.
The pain that wraps around their narrow necks.
The pain of three deep bloody stabs.
The pain that I've got back into my broken heart.
Delete my files twice more.
Cut me up. Beat me up for this sin.
Hang me. Make your vengeance fair.

I'm a leaf in the wind
In the wind of my beliefs
The belief that my life is not vain,
And that my real fate
Is to give to the world
As much as I can give
As a flying old leaf,
As an useless former part of a big tree.
I'm flying with the fast air streams,
Feeling the strength of the belief wind
But always falling down slowly
Due to the hardness of my hopeless existence.
But once the life wind
Suddenly stops
I now have nothing to prevent my free fall.
So as I'm getting closer to the lifeless asphalt
And I kiss it’s rough, dark-gray surface,
That is all. It is my end. 
I will soon rot, not ever making a single flower bloom
To support its useless existence in this cruel game.
But what is that? Is it a brand new wind
That will make my life a moving poem again?
Yes, it is! It is my salvation!
I feel it lift me up with ease, 
helping me win against gravity.
I'm up again! I'm flying again!
High and proud as a bird
Flying somewhere atop tall mountains,
Like I can be more than just a half-dead leaf."""

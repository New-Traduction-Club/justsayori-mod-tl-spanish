The sky is blue.\nIt's a secret, but I trust you too.\nIf it wasn't for you, I could sleep forever.\nBut I'm not mad.\nI want breakfast."

I put it in a bottle to keep it safe.\nAnd I put the bottle on the shelf with all of the other bottles.\nHappy thoughts, happy thoughts, happy thoughts in bottles, all in a row.\nMy collection makes me lots of friends.\nEach bottle a starlight to make amends.\nSometimes my friend feels a certain way.\nDown comes a bottle to save the day.\nNight after night, more dreams.\nFriend after friend, more bottles.\nDeeper and deeper my fingers go.\nLike exploring a dark cave, discovering the secrets hiding in the nooks and crannies.\nDigging and digging.\nScraping and scraping.\nI blow dust off my bottle caps.\nIt doesn't feel like time elapsed.\nMy empty shelf could use some more.\nMy friends look through my locked front door.\nFinally, all done. I open up, and in come my friends.\nIn they come, in such a hurry. Do they want my bottles that much?\nI frantically pull them from the shelf, one after the other.\nHolding them out to each and every friend.\nEach and every bottle.\nBut every time I let one go, it shatters against the tile between my feet.\nHappy thoughts, happy thoughts, happy thoughts in shards, all over the floor.\nThey were supposed to be for my friends, my friends who aren't smiling.\nThey're all shouting, pleading. Something.\nBut all I hear is echo, echo, echo, echo, echo\nInside my head."

It is my end. \nI will soon rot, not ever making a single flower bloom\nTo support its useless existence in this cruel game.\nBut what is that? Is it a brand new wind\nThat will make my life a moving poem again?\nYes, it is! It is my salvation!\nI feel it lift me up with ease, \nhelping me win against gravity.\nI'm up again! I'm flying again!\nHigh and proud as a bird\nFlying somewhere atop tall mountains,\nLike I can be more than just a half-dead leaf."

And there's nothing completely black Just like there's nothing completely white."
